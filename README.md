## Tests
Testing a README generator project involves ensuring that the generated README file meets your expectations and provides accurate and formatted information. Since the main functionality is to generate a README file based on user input, testing would typically involve:

- Running the generator multiple times with various inputs to see if the generated README files are accurate, well-formatted, and contain the expected information. Manually review the generated README files to confirm that all sections are populated correctly.
